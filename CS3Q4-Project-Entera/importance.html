			<h2>How bad are the effect of Climate Change?</h2>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>

			<h2> Higher Heat Index / Higher Temperatures </h2>
			<p> Recently, we have also experienced the sudden change of weathers and temperatures
			here in our place. We either get very high heat index or a very heavy rain and strong winds. 
			Based on studies, The global surface temperature rises together with greenhouse gas 
			concentrations. The hottest decade on record was from 2011 to 2020. Each decade since 
			the 1980s has been warmer than the one before it. There are more hot days and heat waves 
			in almost all geographical locations. Higher temperatures exacerbate heat-related ailments 
			and make it more challenging to work outside. When the weather is hotter, wildfires start 
			more readily and spread more quickly. The Arctic has warmed at least twice as quickly as the
			rest of the world. </p>

			<h2> Increased Drought </h2>
			<p> Water supply is changing due to climate change, becoming more limited in many places. 
			In already water-stressed areas, global warming makes water shortages worse. It also 
			increases the danger of ecological and agricultural droughts, which can harm crops and 
			make ecosystems more vulnerable. Additionally, severe sand and dust storms that may transport 
			billions of tons of sand across continents can be sparked by droughts. As deserts spread, 
			there is less space for agriculture. The fear of regularly not having enough water affects 
			a lot of people nowadays. </p>

			<h2> The Increasing Rate the Loss of Species </h2>
			<p> Both animals on land and in the ocean are at risk from climate change. As the temperatures
			rise, these hazards rise as well. The rate of extinction in the planet is 1,000 times higher 
			now than it has ever been in recorded human history, and this is exacerbated by climate change. 
			Within the next several decades, one million species face extinction. Threats from climate change 
			include exotic pests and illnesses, forest fires, and harsh weather. Others won't be able to move 
			and live, but some species will. </p>

			<h2> Higher risks of Health </h2>
			<p> The single greatest hazard to human health is climate change. Air pollution, sickness, harsh 
			weather, forced relocation, stress on mental health, increasing hunger and inadequate nutrition in 
			areas where people cannot grow or get enough food are only a few of the health effects of climate 
			change. 13 million individuals every year are killed by environmental conditions. Extreme weather 
			events increase fatalities and make it challenging for health care systems to keep up with the 
			growing number of diseases caused by changing weather patterns. </p>

			<h2> Poverty and Displacement </h2>
			<p> Climate change makes it easier for people to fall into and stay in poverty. Floods have the 
			potential to devastate homes and livelihoods in urban slums. Outdoor chores may be challenging 
			to perform in the heat. Crops may be impacted by water shortage. Weather-related disasters have
			uprooted an estimated 23.1 million people annually on average over the previous ten years 
			(2010-2019), leaving millions more at risk of poverty. The majority of refugees are from nations 
			that are least equipped and prepared to adjust to the effects of climate change. </p>
